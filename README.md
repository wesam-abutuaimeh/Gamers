# Gaming Website using React.JS

# Welcome to my gaming website project!

### This is a simple idea for a gaming website that I created using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is designed for laptop users who love playing games online

### What did I use to build this website?
- Hooks: I used React hooks to manage the state and lifecycle of the functional components.
- Context: I used React context to share data across the components without prop drilling.
- Authentication: I used authentication approaches to enable users to sign up, log in, and log out of the website.
- Axios: I used Axios to make HTTP requests to fetch data from external APIs.
- Yup: I used yup to validate the user input and display error messages.
- Clean code: I followed the best practices of writing clean and readable code, such as using meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, proper comments, etc.
- Code splitting: I used code splitting to divide the code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, which improves the performance and user experience of the website.
- Optimization: I used various optimization techniques to enhance the speed and efficiency of the website, such as caching, lazy loading, compression, etc.
